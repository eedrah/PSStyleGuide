Markdown documents on GitHub support linking to any header, so when editing, please observe the following conventions:

1. Keep rules within the section where they make sense.
2. Sections must be header level 3 (have three hashes): `### Naming Conventions`
3. Rules must be headers with an explanatory paragraph
5. Rules should have examples and counter examples
6. Rules should be phrased as the positive, rather than the negative.
  * Don't say: "Avoid using aliases"
  * Do say: "Use full command names"
7. When writing a negative rule, you should always start with "avoid" and end with an "instead" sentence, like:<blockquote><h6>Avoid the use of `~` to represent the home folder.</h6><p>The meaning of ~ is unfortunately dependent on the "current" provider at the time of execution. This isn't really a style issue, but it's an important rule for code you intend to share anyway. <em>Instead</em>, use `${Env:UserProfile}` or `(Get-PSProvider FileSystem).Home`</p></blockquote>
